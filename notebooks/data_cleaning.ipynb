An extended generalized LR algorithm was adapted to the parsing of the proposed formalism to analyze the syntactic structure of a language.

To implement the plant (sensor), controller, and actuator nodes, an agent-based design is introduced, and a multi-agent networked control system is constructed. Therefore, the network simulator 2–26 (NS-2.26) release is extended by modifying the user data protocol (UDP) common header in order to support application data transmission between network nodes. Then, modifying the network topology parameters, networked control system simulations are analyzed for different parameter changes, such as the network bandwidth, the number of plant nodes, and the sampling period. An analysis of the influence of these parameters on network-induced delays and packet drop is made.

However, unlike normal point-to-point multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels, DAS channels have different large-scale fadings from different transmit antennas, thus making equal power and rate transmission that is feasible in MIMO channels unrealistic in DAS channels. This paper proposes a novel transmit antenna selection scheme with power and rate allocation. The scheme is based on large-scale fading (shadow fading and path loss) and is suitable for VBLAST structures with zero-forcing and successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) receivers, ensuring balanced average symbol error rate (SER) performance in each layer. On the receiver side, a fixed detection order is used, which is obtained in the transmit antenna selection process. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme gives good performance gains over equal power and rate transmission systems without antenna selection.',\n",

This paper describes a new efficient pruning method, the multi-weight optimal brain surgeon (MWOBS) method, to optimize neural network topologies. The advantages and disadvantages of the OBS and unit-OBS were analyzed to develop the method. Actually, optimized topologies are difficult to get within reasonable times for complex problems. Motivating by the mechanism of natural neurons, the MW-OBS method balances the accuracy and the time complexity to achieve better neural network performance. The method will delete multiple connections among neurons according to the second derivative of the error function, so the arithmetic converges rapidly while the accuracy of the neural network remains high. The stability and generalization ability of the method are illustrated in a Java program. The results show that the MWOBS method has the same accuracy as OBS, but time is similar to that of unit-OBS. Therefore, the MWOBS method can be used to efficiently optimize structures of neural networks for large scale applications.',\n",

              "  \"In order to unlock the maximum flexibility potential of all levels in the power system, distribution-network-located flexible energy resources (FERs) should play an important role in providing system-wide ancillary services. Frequency reserves are an example of system-wide ancillary services. In this regard, this article deals with the optimal operation of a local energy community (LEC) located in the distribution network. The LEC is proposed to participate in providing manual frequency restoration reserves (mFRR) or tertiary reserves. In addition, the community is supposed to have a number of electric vehicles (EVs) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) as FERs. The scheduling of the community, which is fully compliant with the existing balancing market structure, comprises two stages. The first stage is performed in day-ahead, in which the energy community management center (ECMC) estimates the amount of available flexible capacities for mFRR provision. In this stage, control parameters are deployed by the ECMC in order to control the offered flexibility of the BESS. In the second stage, the real-time scheduling of the community is performed for each hour, taking into account the assigned and activated amount of reserve power. The target of the real-time stage is to maximize the community's profit. Finally, the model is implemented utilizing a case study considering different day-ahead control parameters of the BESS. The results demonstrate that the proposed control parameters adopted in the day-ahead stage considerably affect the real-time profitability of the LEC. Moreover, according to the simulation results, participating in the mFRR market can bring additional profits for the LEC.\",\n",

The main findings are that a convoy provides a worthwhile benefit-cost ratio when more than 30% of the traffics in the convoys and the traffic load exceeds 5500 vehicles/h for a three-lane motorway.

Apparently he is considering only those types of compressors which up till recently have been general on the Rand. As you know, there are now some very large compressors here of the turbine type being put in both at Rosherville and at the Robinson Mine, and if any gentleman present has anything he can tell us about that type of compressor, as compared with reciprocating compressors, I am sure it would be a valuable contribution.\",\n",

A system is analysed in terms of an interference source circuit, an interference receiving circuit and the possible couplings which can exist between the two. Simple equivalent circuits are proposed and the transfer of interference from source to receiver is analysed by means of frequency transfer function techniques. It is shown that earth structures play a very important role in these situations and the role of earth connections, screens etc in suppressing interference is analysed.',\n",

Subsequently the multiple solution to the problem is indicated, stressing that it has mainly a philosophical character, without which the process of environmental impact control, which is also discussed in general, cannot be executed effectively. It is explained that the appropriate philosophy centres around the proper definition of ‘environment’, and that the issue at stake is really the maintenance of balance between nature conservation and cultural development. Finally, the matrix and mapping techniques for documenting data in the environmental impact analysis process are discussed briefly.',\n",

Probably the most important component on such systems is the distribution transformer. It has been estimated that there are about 24 000 of these in the Republic and the annual increase is at present about 2000. This has resulted in the development of a healthy local manufacturing industry. It has also made the general subject of transformers all the more interesting since the members of our Institute now include those directly concerned with all aspects from manufacture to maintenance. At the same time, because there are so many firms manufacturing transformers and so many supply authorities ordering, installing, and maintaining them, there is a relatively wide divergence of opinion on many features concerning this apparently simple bit of apparatus.',\n",

Therefore, a novel analytical model is derived for the 5G signal to evaluate its impact on acquisition performance under three decision methods. The good agreement between the Monte Carlo method (MCM) through software defined receiver (SDR) and the derived expressions validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It can be found that the receivers exhibit varied responses for different 5G waveforms and decision strategies. The receiver also shows the least endurances for some kind of 5G waveforms, however, this kind of adverse effect can be cancelled by a reduced interference signal ratio (ISR), an increased integration time or a larger accumulation times.',\n",

I hope before the discussion closes to have something more to say about it myself, but in the meantime, I should like to ask the author if he would kindly give us in his reply some information relating to the class 5 machines — separators using static electricity. He refers to the fact that in the United States and Mexico particularly, such machines are very largely used, and are very successful. Many of you know that Professor Dobson, some time ago, carried out a number of experiments with a static separator in the laboratory of this College, but I do not know that any practical result came from them. At any rate, many points were brought forward which were of great interest. Personally, I know very little about these static separators and bow far they have been successful in other parts of the world, but 1 am sure that if Mr. Woodworth would give us some figures in connection with them, they would be much appreciated. The static machine, which was used in connection with the experiments I have mentioned, is in the laboratory now, and members will have an opportunity of seeing it working at the close of this meeting.',\n",

              "  'The Action of the X-Ray in Large and Small Doses. — Since the discovery of the X-rays and their application to therapeutics, many and various results have been obtained from their use, results often quite contradictory in character, the explanations of which have at times been distinctly puzzling. It has been difficult in many instances to explain why in one case the use of the rays would cause degeneration and at others regeneration of similar tissues; why, for example, in one patient superflous hair would be removed and in another the use of the rays on a smooth skin would result in a profuse hirsute adornment. In recent years, however means have been devised of regulating the dose of the X-rays and of estimating in units the amount of radiation being administered in each case. This has made the study of the action more accurate and has enabled the illumination of several obscure points. In the Berliner klinische Wochenschrift for May 23, 1910, H. E. Schmidt reports a small series of experiments into the effect of various doses of the X-ray upon cell growth. Having soaked a number of beans in water for six hours he treated the different beans with different doses of rays, and then planted them. His results were quite uniform and demonstrated two points of interest. Whereas those beans which were treated with large doses of the rays were partially or completely inhibited in their growth, as compared to untreated control beans, those which received very small doses were distinctly stimulated; not only were the plants larger and more vigorous, but the flowers were larger and the resulting crop of beans better. From these findings Schmidt suggests that the same principle may apply to animal cells, and experiments which he carried out on an ulcer on the arm suggested that this is the case. If this be so, it is evident that in treating conditions in which healing is desired, as a sluggish ulcer, very small doses of the X-ray should be used, whereas in cases of malignant growth, where tissue destruction is required, large doses are needed, and small doses instead of destraying the neoplasm may do harm rather than good by stimulating it to renewed activity. — Electrical Review and Western Electrician, July 30. 1910, p. 234.',\n",

Anslow, entitled, “Some Considerations affecting the installation of Power at Collieries,” was among those discussed at the meeting at Dunfermline of the Mining Institute of Scotland, on June 17th. Mr. Anslow, in dealing with existing steam plants at collieries, said that these were often destitute of condensing plant, partly on account of difficulties in running winding engines condensing, but he showed that in most cases, except where increased power is required, the cost of adding condensers to improve the economy was not justified. Where extensions are required, however condensing plant and exhaust, or mixed turbines driving electrical generators, will render considerable extra power available without extra steam being required from the boilers. Details were given of a case where an extra 500 KW. was thus made available. Even where a large proportion of steam plant is already condensing, considerable extra power can be obtained by the installation of mixed pressure turbo plant, and particulars were given of an example to illustrate this.',\n",
