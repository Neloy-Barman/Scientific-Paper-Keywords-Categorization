Wafer level packaging could reduce the cost of MEMS based sensors through simplified processing and inexpensive components. A novel vacuum tight seal referred to as the wedge seal method is proposed in this paper. The seal consists of a silicon wedge forced into a pliable material (typically a metal) that is attached to the component wafer.

This paper proposes a private user data protection mechanism in TrustZone to avoid such risks. We add corresponding modules to both the secure world and the normal world and authenticate the identity of CA to prevent illegal access to private user data. Then we analyze the system security, and perform validity and performance tests. The results show that this method can ...   \n","26450  Synthetic aperture radar is a microwave technique to extracting image information of the target. Electromagnetic waves that are reflected from the target are acquired by the aircraft or satellite receivers and sent to a ground station to be processed by applying computational demanding algorithms. Radar data streams are acquired by an aircraft or satellite and sent to a ground station to be processed in order to extract images from the data since these processing algorithms are computationally demanding. However, novel applications require real-time processing for real-time analysis and de...   \n","19638  When I heard that next year this Institute is to celebrate fifty years of existence, during which it has grown to more than ten times its original size, and knowing that it would not be possible for me to be with you on that occasion, although I very much hoped at one time that that would be possible, it seemed to me not inappropriate that we might devote our time this evening to a consideration of the past one hundred years, during which the remarkable electrical technology which we know today started from quite simple beginnings.

However, for most of the FPGA end users, they can only obtain bitstream, rather than the RTL code. Therefore, we present a new FPGA reverse engineering tool-chain. It can precisely transform the FPGA bitstream to an RTL code and therefore assists in HT detection. In detail, we first construct an integrated database involving the FPGA architecture information an...   \n","30734  The coordinated control of parallel three-phase four-wire converters in autonomous AC microgrids is investigated in this paper. Firstly, based on droop control, virtual impedance is inserted in positive-, negative- and zero-sequences to enhance system damping and imbalance power sharing. Then, to facilitate virtual impedance design, small signal models of the three-sequence equivalent circuits are established respectively.

Firstly, based on droop control, virtual impedance is inserted in positive-, negative- and zero-sequences to enhance system damping and imbalance power sharing. Then, to facilitate virtual impedance design, small signal models of the three-sequence equivalent circuits are established respectively. Corresponding indexes are proposed to evaluate the impact of sequence virtual impedance on current sharing accuracy, voltage quality at the point of common coupling (PCC) and system stability comprehensively. In addition, constraint of dc-link voltage is also considered to avoid over modulation when subjected to unbalanced loads. Furthermore, to address the PCC voltage degradation resulted from the virtual impedance, a voltage imbalance compensation method based on low-bandwidth communication is proposed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the correctness of the theory model, indicating that the proposed method can achieve PCC voltage restoration while guaranteeing the current sharing accuracy with desirable dynamics.\""],"metadata":{"id":"3vd6wBWwu6dH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705561512904,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Dip
