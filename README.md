<strong></strong>

<h3><code style="color:blue">Objective</code></h3>
<strong>Keywords is a necessary part of a scientific paper. It helps search engines to show papers to users based on relatable topics. So, choosing these words properly is really important. The goal here now is to create a developed and optimized keyword categorizer that can classify a scientific paper between particular keywords based on the abstrat of the paper. </strong>

        <strong>After a scraper script runs for a long time, sometimes it shows "Aw, Snap!" message in the running chrome. In that case, I just reloaded the webpage mannually and then it started working properly as previous.</strong><br/>

    </li>
    <li><strong>The required webelements distribution in all webpages wasn't the same. For some webpages, the scraper collecting details were working fine but it showed exceptions for those. So, I had to re-write some codes considering the different ones and generalize the codes.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>As I had to collect a lot of data, so, I created same type of scrapers and running them simultaneously from different indexes. It boosted my data collection process a bit although it depended much on internet speed.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>In the end, it took huge time to collect a desirable amount of data. So, I had to wait with patience.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Some abstracts contains values like "Retracted.", "Final version", "IEEE Plagarism Policy." and some more unconsiderable values. So, I went through the whole dataset and found these values mannually for the data cleaning process.</strong></li>
</ul>
